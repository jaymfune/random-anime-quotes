# Random Anime Quotes

- This project is a random anime quotes generator for all the anime lovers out there who need some inspiration from their favourite anime characters.
- The reason behind this project was to test my JavaScript skill in a fun way by using an API to create some dynamic content to display.
- I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript as I am in the process of learning Web Development I thought using these technologies would be the best way for me to apply some of the things I have already learnt.

# Lessons
- In this project I learnt two ways you can work with API data with .then method and async/await method.
- I also got to understand promises which you always get when working with the async/await function and callbacks and the problems the may cause when working with them.
